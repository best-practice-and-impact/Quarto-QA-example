# Quarto-QA-example

Demonstrating automated quality assurance (QA) reporting using Quarto.

## Full project description

This project is a linear regression pipeline built to demonstrate how Quarto can be used in Python to automate the production of QA reports, minimising unnecessary 
hassle when it comes to storing and checking QA outputs. This makes it easier for analysis to be peer reviewed, and guarantees a clearer audit trail, helping to bring 
new code in line with the
ONS' [RAP Minimum Viable Product criteria](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/blob/master/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md).

## Installation

1. Install the Quarto command-line interface (CLI) from the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) or using `pip install quarto` from the command line.
If using Visual Studio, you should additionally install the Quarto VSCode extension.

2. After cloning the repository to your machine, navigate to the project directory within your command/Powershell prompt and install/update all package dependencies 
using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
